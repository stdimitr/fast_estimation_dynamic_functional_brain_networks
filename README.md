# fast_estimation_dynamic_functional_brain_networks

This small toolbox implements a fast estimation of PLV, iPLV, PLI and Pearson's correlation over the Hilberted envelope and cosine
for the construction of dynamic functional brain networks from multichannel recordings.

If you find interesting this toolbox and you use it for your own research,
you should cite one the following article:
